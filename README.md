This project reads a bitacora.txt file containing log entries and sorts the entries based on specific criteria using different sorting algorithms. The project aims to demonstrate how sorting algorithms can be applied to real-world data by organizing the logs in an efficient manner. This implementation includes:

	•	Importing and parsing a bitacora.txt file.
	•	Sorting the log entries by date, time, or other relevant fields.
	•	Implementing various sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, etc.).
	•	Analyzing the number of comparisons made during sorting.
